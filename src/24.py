# This is just an example of how you might start your Python code for Math Homework.
# You can replace this with actual mathematics or logic commands that correspond to what you are working on in your project.

# Example: Add 2 and 3
print(2 + 3)

# Example: Calculate the square root of a number (assuming 'a' is a number)
import math
print(math.sqrt(16))

# Example: Swap two numbers (assuming 'x' and 'y' are two variables)
x = 5
y = 10
z = x, y  # This assumes Python supports unpacking of tuples for swapping values

# Example: Print a random number between 1 and 10 (inclusive)
import random
print(random.randint(1, 10))
